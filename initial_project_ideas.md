## Capstone Project Ideas - Erkan Turker

1. **Game Price App** is a price comparison website for digital PC games. We track prices across multiple stores, including Steam, GreenManGaming, Fanatical, and many others. Users can create their own favorites or wishlists, and the app will send them notifications about price drops or new releases.

    - Tech: Database: Postgresql API service: Flask FrontEnd - Javascript HTML and CSS(Bootstrap)

2. **Fitness Tracker:** is  a web application that helps users track their fitness activities and progress. Users can log their workouts, set fitness goals, and view their progress over time. Use Flask for the backend to store user fitness data, and Jinja for rendering workout logs and progress charts on the frontend.

3. **Task Manager:** is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do lists. Users can create, update, and delete tasks, set deadlines, and mark tasks as completed. Use Flask for the backend to handle task data and Jinja for rendering task lists and details on the frontend.
